// <p>Item AA 338/5/7 includes photographic images that are supplementary to Norman Barnett Tindale's journal 'Expedition G. Expedition to Cockatoo Creek, Central Australia. August 6-27, 1931. Journal and field notes by Norman B. Tindale. 1931' (AA 338/1/7). The expedition to Central Australia was organised by the Board for Anthropological Research (BAR) and Tindale participated in this trip primarily as ethnographer and photographer. The research was undertaken among Anmatjera, Ngalia and Walpiri people.<br><br>This group of images has been compiled from loose photographs as well as photographs from the album (apparently put together by Tindale). The photograph album comprised 50 cardboard pages, interleaved with blank protection sheets - currently placed in Vol. 1. Some of the album pages are blank: pp. 45-47 and pp. 49-50 (Vol. 2). To comply with archival preservation requirements, the album has been disassembled and the mounted photographs have been placed, together with their duplicates, in the archival folders. <br><br>This amounted to four volumes of photographic material consisting of b/w photographic prints, contact prints and acetate and possibly nitrate negatives. The images are focussed on camp life; tool making; hunting and food gathering and preparation (Vol. 1; Vol. 2 and Vol. 3). The third volume contains images relating to ceremonial activities and these items are restricted to men only. <br><br>See also related collections: Board for Anthropological Research (see AA 346); Herbert Matthew Hale (see AA 124); John Burton Cleland (see AA 60) and John Hugo Gray (see AA 111). The expedition party had also recorded a motion picture disclosing very similar themes to those covered by photographs. There are copies (AA 346/9/5) available in the South Australian Museum Archives.<br><br>Please note Tindale' abbreviations: CA., C.A., C. Aust (Central Australia); Mt (Mount); C.C. Ck, Cockatoo Ck.
